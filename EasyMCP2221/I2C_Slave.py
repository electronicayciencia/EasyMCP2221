class I2C_Slave:
    """ EasyMCP2221's I2C slave device.

    I2C_Slave helper class allows you to interact with I2C devices in a more object-oriented way.

    Usually you create new instances of this class using :func:`EasyMCP2221.Device.I2C_Slave` function. See *examples* section.

    Parameters:
        mcp (EasyMCP2221.Device): MCP2221 connected to this slave
        addr  (int) : Slave's I2C bus address
        force (bool, optional): Create an I2C_Slave even if the target device does not answer. Default: False.
        speed (int, optional): I2C bus speed. Valid values from 50000 to 400000. See :func:`EasyMCP2221.Device.I2C_speed`.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the device didn't acknowledge.

    Examples:
        You should create I2C_Slave objects from the inside of an EasyMCP2221.Device:

        >>> import EasyMCP2221
        >>> mcp = EasyMCP2221.Device()
        >>> eeprom = mcp.I2C_Slave(0x50)
        >>> eeprom
        EasyMCP2221's I2C slave device at bus address 0x50.

        Or in a stand-alone way:

        >>> import EasyMCP2221
        >>> from EasyMCP2221 import I2C_Slave
        >>> mcp = EasyMCP2221.Device()
        >>> eeprom = I2C_Slave.I2C_Slave(mcp, 0x50)

    Note:
        MCP2221 firmware exposes a subset of predefined I2C operations, but does not allow I2C primitives (i.e. start, stop, read + ack, read + nak, clock bus, etc.).
