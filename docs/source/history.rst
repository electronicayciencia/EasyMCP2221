Older releases
--------------

This project was initially a fork of PyMCP2221A library by Yuta KItagami (https://github.com/nonNoise/PyMCP2221A).

I did a few changes, then a few more, until I ended up rewriting almost all the code. Since the API is no longer compatible with PyMCP2221A, I decided to create a new package.

Tags v1.4 and earlier are from PyMCP2221A.
