History
=======

V1.5.0
------

First EasyMCP2221 version.


Older releases
--------------

This project was initially a fork of PyMCP2221A library by Yuta KItagami (https://github.com/nonNoise/PyMCP2221A). But I did a few changes, then more, until finally I rewrote almost all the code. 

Since the API is no longer compatible with PyMCP2221A, I decided to create a separate package.

Tags v1.4 and earlier are PyMCP2221A.
