Easy MCP2221 project
=====================================================

Easy MCP2221 is a Python module to interface the chip MCP2221 and MCP2221A.

Some projects, like MicroPython, port Python to a microcontroller.

This one, by contrast, brings basic **microcontroller capabilities into a regular PC**.

MCP2221 is a simple 14 pin chip with:

- 4 GPIO
- 3 channel ADC
- 1 DAC
- I2C
- UART
- Clock Output
- USB Wake-up via Interrupt Detection.

You can interface all of it using USB interface.

Which, in my opinion, makes it great to **learn the basics of microcontrollers** and robotics using nothing more than a regular computer, a protoboard and Python environment.
