The objective of this project is to provide a **normal computer** with the capabilities of a **basic microcontroller**.

Easy MCP2221 is a Python module to interface the chip MCP2221 and MCP2221A.

MCP2221 is a simple 14 pin chip with USB interface and these peripherals:

- 4 GPIO
- 3 channel ADC
- DAC
- I2C
- UART
- Clock Output
- USB Wake-up via Interrupt Detection.

You can practice the basics of digital electronics, microcontrollers, and robotics using nothing more than a regular computer, a breadboard, a few parts, and Python.
