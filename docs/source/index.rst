Easy MCP2221 is a Python module to interface with Microchip MCP2221 and MCP2221A.

Connected to the USB port, this 14 pin chip part can provide a **normal computer** with the capabilities of a **basic microcontroller**.

MCP2221's peripherals:

- 4 GPIO
- 3 channel ADC
- DAC
- I2C
- UART
- Clock Output
- USB Wake-up via Interrupt Detection.

So you can practice the basics of digital electronics, microcontrollers, and robotics using nothing more than a regular computer, a breadboard, a few parts, and Python.
