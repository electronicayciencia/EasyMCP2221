# Read ADS115 while blinking a LED
# This example is similar to ads1115_with_gpio.py. But it takes advantage of the automatic 
# MCP Device Object re-use in library versions above 1.8.1.
# This feature prevents double driving of the same device from two objects in the same process.

# create another instance of EasyMCP2221.Device class driving the same physical device.
# Newer versions of EasyMCP2221 will detect it and return the same object above.

# Get the ADS1x15's inner mcp device object.
